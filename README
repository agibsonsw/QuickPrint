Quick printing (no formatting) of the current view:
Currently Windows ONLY. [Note: the Console will flash 
open on starting ST. It also adds a .txt file to the 
users' TEMP folder.]

First, SHARE YOUR PRINTER;
Make a note of your computer-name and the printer-name;
Add these values to the package settings (although the 
computer-name can be omitted);
The print option appears in the context-menu, or you 
can add a key-binding for the command "quick_print".
[I prefer to use the context-menu because, if it 
appears in the file menu, then users would probably 
anticipate a dialog or print-preview to appear.]

In the settings you can optionally specify:
how many blank lines to add at the top of each page;
number of spaces to be added on the left;
the number of lines to print per page.

If you explicitly state the number of lines to 
print per page then this makes it possible to 
create headers and footers, although this is not 
currently implemented.

Possible TODOs:
Find the equivalent Linux/Apple dos-commands(?);
Ability to print selection, or multi-select;
Specifying (approximate) page-range to print;
Settings for alternative port (from LPT1) and 
number of blank lines at bottom of each page;
Setting for the number of characters per line;
Headers and Footers, particularly page numbers.

It would be possible to create an approximation 
to a print preview:
create a read-only view; 
temporarily change to a simple-white theme;
use dashes or underlines to indicate page-ends;
include the header/footer info;
show the input panel so the user can press Enter 
to print, or specify a page-range before printing.
